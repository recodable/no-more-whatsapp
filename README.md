# No More WhatsApp üôÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to trademark issue with WhatsApp, we moved the project over https://nomorewhatsapp.recodable.io

Information website about how to export your data from WhatsApp before the [controversial privacy policy update](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/).

In addition to informations, we also provide an explorer app to allow user to have a more visual render of their WhatsApp data.

This app will **never** store any of the data provided.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
