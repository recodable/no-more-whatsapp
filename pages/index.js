          <div>
            <h3>1. Signal</h3>

            <p>
              Open source and created with privacy in mind. It's the one of the
              most secure messaging app you can find as it stores no personal
              data and is endorced by giant in the privacy space like Edward
              Snowden.

          <div>
            <h3>2. Wire</h3>

            <p>
              One main advantage Wire has over Signal is the fact that it's
              based in EU and is protected by European Law compare to Signal
              which is based in the US. Besides of that, the features and level
              of privacy are relatively similar.

          <div>
            <h3>3. Telegram</h3>

            <p>
              Telegram is encrypted end-to-end and offers a cloud-based solution
              which means your data are store on a server unlike Wire and
              Signal, it allows to have easier synchronisation across multiple
              device.

            <p>
              Not that anybody trusted Facebook with our data before that
              privacy policy update.
            </p>

            <p>
              But if your goal is to have any privacy online, you should not use
              any Facebook product. Period.
